# What is a PWA 🦕

### Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

<Appear>
  <p></p>
  <p>Reliable - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.</p>
  <p>Fast - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.</p>
  <p>Engaging - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.</p>
  <p>This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.</p>
</Appear>

```notes
- Create speaker notes in fenced code blocks
```

export default Split

---

## App manifest


https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest


```notes
- Create speaker notes in fenced code blocks
```

---

## Display

Defines the developers’ preferred display mode for the website.

---

### Browser

The application opens in a conventional browser tab or new window, depending on the browser and platform. _This is the default._

---

### Fullscreen

All of the available display area is used and no user agent chrome is shown. 	standalone

---

### Standalone

  The application will look and feel like a standalone application.
  This can include the application having a different window, its own icon in the application launcher, etc.
  In this mode, the user agent will exclude UI elements for controlling navigation, but can include other UI elements such as a status bar.

---

### Minimal-ui

The application will look and feel like a standalone application, but will have a minimal set of UI elements for controlling navigation.
The elements will vary by browser.

## Meta data

OS and Microsoft Edge and still need some metadata to make the app installable.
First, for iOS, it needs three `<meta>` tags. Let's say meta name.
They all start with apple-mobile-web-app and have a content property.


```notes
- Create speaker notes in fenced code blocks
```

---

### Capable

This meta tag tells iOS that this web app is installable.

---

### Status bar

Configure the status-bar-style, which it can be default, which is just the user's status bar.

IOS  - default, black, black-translucent

---

### Title

The appliction, most likely the same as the app manifest
