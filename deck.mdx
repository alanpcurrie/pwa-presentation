#  Unit Testing  🐛

# A test is something that throws an error if there is a problem ❌

#  unit testing ✔️🔬


```notes
Unit testing is a software development process in which
the smallest testable parts of an application,
called units, are individually and independently scrutinized
for proper opera
```

#  AAA (Arrange, Act, Assert) 📋

```notes

    The Arrange section of a unit test method initializes objects and sets the value of the data that is passed to the method under test.

    The Act section invokes the method under test with the arranged parameters.

    The Assert section verifies that the action of the method under test behaves as expected.

```notes

 naming and structuring tests
  jest assestions
  Jest snapshot
  jest watch
  jest axe
  jest lighthouse

We can add the --watch flag to this to keep this running in the background as we create and edit new tesk

Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI does not change unexpectedly.

A typical snapshot test case for a mobile app renders a UI component, takes a snapshot,
then compares it to a reference snapshot file stored alongside the test. The test will fail
if the two snapshots do not match: either the change is unexpected,
or the reference snapshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.

# Code Coverage 🌐


```notes

    instanbul under the hood

    <https://istanbul.js.org/>

    Function coverage Has each function (or subroutine) in the program been called?
    Statement coverage Has each statement in the program been executed?
    Branch coverage Has each branch  of each control structure (such as in if and case statements) been executed? For example, given an if statement, have both the true and false branches been executed? Another way of saying this is, has every edge in the program been executed?
    Line coverage has each executable line in the source file been executed?

# TDD 🏎️

```notes
Start by writing a test
Run the test and any other tests. At this point, your newly added test should fail. If it doesn’t fail here, it might not be testing the right thing and thus has a bug in it.
Write the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass
Run the tests to check the new test passes
Optionally refactor your code
Repeat

```
