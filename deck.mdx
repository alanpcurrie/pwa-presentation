# What is a PWA ü¶ï

### Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

<Appear>
  <p></p>
  <p>Reliable - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.</p>
  <p>Fast - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.</p>
  <p>Engaging - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.</p>
  <p>This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.</p>
</Appear>

## App shell üêö

The App shell concept is concerned with loading a minimal user interface as soon as possible and then caching it so it is available offline for subsequent visits before then loading all the contents of the app.

---

### App shell contiued.....

The next time someone visits the app from the device.

The UI loads from the cache immediately and any new content is requested from the server (if it isn‚Äôt available in the cache already).

---

### ...and a bit more about App shell

This structure is fast, and also feels fast as the user sees "something" instantly,

instead of a loading spinner or a blank page. It also allows the website to be accessible offline if the network connection is not available.

---

### Getting assets into the App shell

We can control what is requested from the server and what is retrieved from the cache with a service worker... more on that later.... üéâ

---

## App manifest üìñ

The web app manifest is a JSON file that tells the browser about your web application and how it should behave when 'installed' on the user's mobile device or desktop.

Having a manifest is required by Chrome to show the Add to Home Screen prompt.


<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest>

### Browser

The application opens in a conventional browser tab or new window, depending on the browser and platform. _This is the default._

---

<Image src={require("!file-loader!./img/browser.jpg")} size="contain"/>

---

### Fullscreen
All of the available display area is used and no user agent chrome is shown.

---

<Image src={require("!file-loader!./img/fullscreen.jpg")} size="contain"/>

---

### Standalone

The application will look and feel like a standalone application.

This can include the application having a different window, its own icon in the application launcher, etc.

In this mode, the user agent will exclude UI elements for controlling navigation, but can include other UI elements such as a status bar.

---

<Image src={require("!file-loader!./img/standalone.jpg")} size="contain"/>

---

### Minimal-ui

The application will look and feel like a standalone application, but will have a minimal set of UI elements for controlling navigation.
The elements will vary by browser.

---

### Sorry no pics ü§∑

## Meta data for non android browsers

IOS and Microsoft Edge and still need some metadata to make the app installable.

For iOS, it needs three `<meta>` tags. They all start with apple-mobile-web-app and have a content property.


```notes

```notes

```

---

### Title

The appliction, most likely the same as the app manifest

---

### Homescreen icon

The icon that will be displayed in the iOS home screen. We will do this with a `<link>` tag.
In the rel property, the apple-touch-icon, and add the path to the smaller icon here.

We also have to add tags for edge...  The first one is TileImage. Again, we'll write here the path to the smaller icon.
The other property is TileColor, which is the tile color that Windows uses to place the tile icon in the home screen.

---

### Capable

This meta tag tells iOS that this web app is installable.

---

### Status bar

Configure the status-bar-style, which it can be default, which is just the user's status bar.

IOS  - default, black, black-translucent

---

## Service workers

A service worker is a script that runs in the background without access to the UI, and a requisite for a Progressive Web App.
They can be used for caching requests and assets.

```notes
- Create speaker notes in fenced code blocks
```
export default Split

---

### More service workers

+ Service Workers are a virtual proxy between the browser and the network.
+ They run on a separate thread from the main JavaScript code of the page, and don't have any access to the DOM structure.
+ Non blocking API
+ You are able to give a Service Worker something to work on, and receive the result whenever it is ready using a Promise-based approach.

---

### Service workers life cycle üßü

  <p></p>
  <p>Parsed</p>
  <p>Installed</p>

  <p>Activated</p>
  <p>Redundant</p>
</Appear>

```notes
- Create speaker notes in fenced code blocks
```

export default Split

---

### Parsed

When we first attempt to register a Service Worker, the user agent parses the script and obtains the entry point.

If parsing is successful (and some other requirements, e.g. HTTPS, are met),

we will have access to the Service Worker registration object.

---

### Installing

The first event a service worker gets is install. It's triggered as soon as the worker executes,

it's only called once per service worker.

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="‚öôÔ∏è Service worker example‚öôÔ∏è"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./examples/serviceworker.js")}
  lang="javascript"
  showNumbers={true}
  theme={nightOwl}
  dark={false}
  steps={[
    { lines: [1], notes: "Registering a service worker, Browsers that support Service Worker expose service worker on the global navigator object. ‚úèÔ∏è" },
    { range: [3,11], notes: "Check if the browser supports service workers, if the navigator object has a serviceWorker property ‚úèÔ∏è" },
  ]}
/>

---

### Installed

Once the Service Worker script has been parsed,

the user agent attempts to install it and it moves to the installing state.

---

### Activating

The activating state will be triggered for a waiting Service Worker in one of the following scenarios -

  If there is no current active worker already

  If the `self.skipWaiting()` method is called in the Service Worker script

  If the user has navigated away from the page, thereby releasing the previous active worker

  If a specified period of time has passed, thereby releasing the previous active worker

---

### Activated

  If activation is successful, the Service Worker moves to the active state.

  In this state, it is an active worker in full control of the document.

---

### Redundant

A Service Worker can become redundant for one of the following reasons -

  If the installing event failed

  If the activating event failed

  If a new Service Worker replaces it as the active service worker

---

### Service workers scope üéØ

  * The service worker will only catch requests from clients under the service worker's scope.
  * The max scope for a service worker is the location of the worker.
  * If your server worker is active on a client being served with the Service-Worker-Allowed header,
        you can specify a list of max scopes for that worker.
  * In Firefox, Service Worker APIs are hidden and cannot be used when the user is in private browsing mode.

## Network Strategy

With network strategies, you can tune which types of requests should
get the freshest content possible and which should try to get responses
from cache. That helps improve online performance by avoiding
unnecessary network round trips for static assets.

## Precache continued...

Service Worker Precache is a module for generating a service worker that precaches resources.

It integrates with your build process. Once configured, it detects all your static resources
(HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, etc.) and generates a hash of each file's contents.

Information about each file's URL and versioned hash are stored in the generated service worker file,
along with logic to serve those files cache-first and automatically keep those files up to date when changes are detected in subsequent builds.

## ‚ú®Bonus Nugget ! ‚ú® Fat Arrow Functions üî•‚û°Ô∏è

browser that supports Service Worker does, the same goes for CONST and LET, no babel required.

## Navigator API - Check online status ‚õµÔ∏è

Returns the online status of the browser. The property returns a boolean value, with true meaning online and false meaning offline.

---

### More Navigator

The property sends updates whenever the browser's ability to connect to the network changes. The update occurs when the user follows links or when a script requests a remote page.

For example, the property should return false when users click links soon after they lose internet connection.

### Using the Navigator

## Push Notifications üêè

native application like push notifications

A notification is a message that pops up on the user's device. Notifications can be triggered locally by an open application,
or they can be "pushed" from the server to the user even when the app is not running.

**USE CASE** - fresh content alert, offline warning alert
