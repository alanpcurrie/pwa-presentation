# What is a PWA 🦕

### Progressive Web Apps are user experiences that have the reach of the web, and are:

<Appear>
  <p></p>
  <p>Reliable - Load instantly and never show the downasaur, even in uncertain network conditions.</p>
  <p>Fast - Respond quickly to user interactions with silky smooth animations and no janky scrolling.</p>
  <p>Engaging - Feel like a natural app on the device, with an immersive user experience.</p>
  <p>This new level of quality allows Progressive Web Apps to earn a place on the user's home screen.</p>
